# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

The USGS (United States Geological Survey) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

This project builds a set of tools that will allow visualization of  earthquake data. USGS collects a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, this project provides a meaningful way of displaying it. 

### Repository Structure

1. This repository `leaflet-challenge`. 

2. Two folders to correspond to the challenges: **Leaflet-Step-1** and **Leaflet-Step-2**.

4. This project utilizes both **html** and **Javascript**. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

## Project Tasks

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get your data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * The legend provides context for tge map data.

   * The visualization looks like the map above.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

This task plots a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity, pulling in a second data set and visualize it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

This step

* Plots a second data set on the map.

* Adds a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Adds layer controls to the map.
